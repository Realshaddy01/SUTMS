An AI-enhanced violation tracking system capable of detecting violations, verifying vehicles instantly, and issuing alerts to both traffic authorities and vehicle owners.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main components:
- Django Backend: Handles API requests, database operations, and AI processing
- Flutter Frontend: Mobile application for users and traffic officers

## Features

- **AI-Powered Detection**: Automatically detect traffic violations using computer vision
- **Real-time Notifications**: Instant alerts to both traffic authorities and vehicle owners
- **QR-based Verification**: Quick vehicle verification through QR codes
- **OCR Technology**: Automatic license plate recognition
- **Payment Integration**: Seamless violation fee payment system
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Comprehensive traffic violation analytics
- **User Management**: Different access levels for vehicle owners and traffic officers

## Technologies Used

### Backend (django strickly recommended dont change it)
- Django REST Framework
- mySQL
- Channels for WebSockets
- TensorFlow/PyTorch for AI models
- Redis for caching
- Celery for background tasks

### Frontend (flutter  strickly recommended dont change it)
- Flutter for cross-platform mobile development
- Provider for state management
- Firebase for push notifications
- Camera integration for violation detection
- QR code scanning capabilities

4. Set up Firebase or supabase(optional for push notifications):
   - Create a Firebase project
   - Download `google-services.json` for Android and place it in `android/app/`
   - Download `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS and place it in `ios/Runner/`
